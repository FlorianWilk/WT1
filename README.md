# WT1 - yet another 3D-printed autonomous Robot

- fully 3D-printed 
- uses Arduino Mega as Controller
- based on NVidia Jetson Nano and Arduino Mega
- uses ROS as Software-Stack
- SLAM when using the Lidar

WT1 is another fully 3D-printed, autonomous Robot on Tracks and is intent as a Platform for 
getting in touch with Robotics, Hardware, ROS, SLAM, Navigation, ObjectDetection and much more.
